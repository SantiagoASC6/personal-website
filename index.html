          <div class="col"> During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the country of Japan underwent many changes internally, and was forced to alter their skill strengths from their notoriously ruthless military, to working towards producing technologically advanced products. In September of 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd., which originally produced handmade hanafuda cards. These cards became very popular in Japan, and after several decades of success, the cards were brought over to the U.S. by Fusajiro’s grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi. The cards were unsuccessful in America, causing Yamauchi to consider the fact that playing cards had become an out-of-date past time to Americans. They needed something more refreshing and original than the hanafuda cards. It wasn’t until Nintendo released the arcade game Donkey Kong to America that the video gaming industry truly started to take off and become popular amongst the people. Nintendo took the idea of playing an electronic video game in an arcade, and made it better by creating video games, gaming systems, and handheld devices available for Americans to buy, and to play in the comfort of their own home.   </div>

          <div class="col">Arrogance Before a Fall People encounter arrogance on a daily basis. However, not many people are aware of the detrimental effects that come with arrogance and pride. This concept of arrogance is explored in William Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of Julius Caesar. Many characters in this play are corrupted with arrogance, and it always ends up hurting them. The play opens up with Julius Caesar, the ruler of Rome, returning to the city after defeating Pompey, his rival, in battle. While he is celebrated by the Roman citizens, a group of superiors are concerned that Caesar is gaining too much power.  </div>

          <div class="col">Potatoes have a popular use in fast food, like French fries, tater tots, hash browns etc. Potatoes can be found in any supermarket, and in many different parts of the world. The Potatoes was actually the name of a short-lived anti-bullying club at Lincoln. What a lot of people don’t know is where they are from, how they grow, and what they are. Potatoes grow in full sunlight, and need it to survive. They are aggressively rooting plants, which means they constantly grow more roots, which means they need a lot of space for their enormous root systems.</div>
